# Sverdrup — Progress notebook

## Current work (index — do not duplicate task state here)

- **Phase 3: GMRF method + representation-agnostic generalization — PLANNED, ready to execute.**
  - Scope (source of truth): `phase3_scope_spec.md` (settled; §5.1 now records the two
    settled forks — scikit-sparse/CHOLMOD backend + temporal-taper-into-R conditioning — and
    the forward-compat Projection abstraction).
  - Design = the spec; Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-phase3-gmrf-representation-generalization.md`
    (11 tasks; tracker `.tasks.json` co-located, all `pending`).
  - **Hard-gated sequencing:** Stage A (Tasks 1–3, generalize OI under green) → Stage B
    (Tasks 4–9, add GMRF) → Stage C (Tasks 10–11). Three user-gates: Task 3 (Stage-A
    regression, 129/2 must stay green — if OI changes, surface it, don't adjust tests),
    Task 5 (Takahashi vs dense-Q⁻¹ oracle — red = math bug, not a tolerance loosen),
    Task 9 (Stage-B GMRF blend validation — spec-§8 escalation on failure).
  - **Key architecture decisions (canonical — see Cross-cutting decisions Phase 3):**
    two-point dispatch split (reduction by live-operator representation pre-persistence;
    coherence driver by persisted `sampler_spec` post-persistence); `to_persisted` is a
    `ReductionStrategy` in `distributions/reduction.py`, NOT on the core Protocol
    (invariant 1 + one-way dependency rule); GMRF read off the precision via a `Projection`
    (grid=identity, off-grid=bilinear) so a later FEM phase needs only a new projection.
- **Phase 2: tiling / blend / coherent uncertainty — COMPLETE (all 17 tasks 0–16).**
  - Scope (source of truth): `phase2_scope_spec.md` (committed `fa93897`).
  - Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-phase2-tiling-blend-architecture-design.md`.
  - Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-phase2-tiling-blend.md`
    (17 tasks, 0–16); tracker `.tasks.json` co-located, all `completed`.
  - **Both user gates PASSED with captured AC evidence:** Stage A (Task 15 — regional blend
    == single-tile, no seam, conservative σ, withheld OSSE+OSE eval, provenance, both
    withholding exemplars) and Stage B (Task 16 — projection-mixed partition, sample-based
    `regrid`, cross-CRS blend, polar-void relax-to-prior, opt-in global skipped cleanly).
  - **Key §8 resolution (see Cross-cutting decisions):** the structured coherent-sample
    driver is the shared-overlap-basis (Löwdin) construction, NOT member-only `z_r`.
  - Suite: 129 passed / 2 skipped (Stage-B global run + one pre-existing skip).
  - **DEFERRED to Task 15:** `run_tiled_pipeline` in `application/pipeline.py`. The plan's Task-12 Step 3 only implements `TilingCoordinator` (which IS done + tested) and says the pipeline wiring is "exercised in Task 15". The eval impedance — `_evaluate` reads `product.per_time[].base.fields.mean`, but the coordinator returns `BlendedDistribution`s — is resolved when Task 15's integration test defines the contract. Build `run_tiled_pipeline` there.
- **Milestone: rename to `sverdrup` + PyPI release — COMPLETE (Tasks 1–7).**
  - Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-sverdrup-pypi-release-design.md` (approved).
  - Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-21-sverdrup-pypi-release.md` (7 tasks);
    tracker `.tasks.json` all `completed`.
  - Package renamed `regatta`→`sverdrup`; hatchling + hatch-vcs tag-driven build; Apache-2.0 +
    metadata + `py.typed`; core deps + `dask`/`io`/`all` extras; Trusted-Publishing workflow
    shipped at `docs/superpowers/ci/release.yml` (Option B). User-gate (clean-venv install smoke)
    re-validated. Public repo `killett/sverdrup` created and `main` pushed.
  - **DONE end-to-end:** all three user-side steps completed by the user — workflow installed,
    PyPI Trusted Publisher configured, `v0.1.0` tagged+pushed. `sverdrup 0.1.0` is **live on
    PyPI** (wheel+sdist, Apache-2.0); `pip install sverdrup` verified in a clean venv.
- **conda-forge distribution (in progress):**
  - Recipe generated via `grayskull` (run with `pixi exec grayskull`, not added to manifest),
    polished, and committed at `conda-recipe/meta.yaml` (+ `conda-recipe/README.md`).
  - `noarch: python`; sdist sha256 verified against PyPI; confirmed the sdist builds **without
    `.git`** (hatch-vcs reads version from PKG-INFO) — so conda-forge's sdist build works.
  - **Auto-update mechanism (the goal):** after the one-time `conda-forge/staged-recipes` PR,
    the conda-forge **autotick bot** watches PyPI and opens a version-bump PR on every PyPI
    release. Steady state: push tag → PyPI Action publishes → bot opens feedstock PR → merge.
  - **staged-recipes PR OPEN:** https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/33814
    (`killett:sverdrup`). Awaiting conda-forge CI + maintainer review/merge → feedstock
    auto-created → conda package ships. User responds to any reviewer feedback.
  - **Gotcha:** the autotick bot only bumps version+hash. When `pyproject.toml` runtime deps
    change, mirror them into `requirements/run` in both `conda-recipe/meta.yaml` and the
    feedstock PR.
  - **Gotcha (CI failure, fixed):** first staged-recipes build #1541860 FAILED on all platforms
    in the *test* phase: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dask'`. Cause — the recipe test
    ran `python -m sverdrup`, but `__main__.py` eagerly imports the dask executor + pipeline
    (the `dask`/`io` *optional extras*, not core run deps). The conda test env has only core
    deps. Fix: test only the core import surface (`import sverdrup`, `sverdrup.core.grid`,
    `pip check`) — never the entry point — since core deps are all that's guaranteed installed.
    Same trap will bite any feedstock test: do not add extras-dependent checks to `test:`.
- **Phase 1: COMPLETE** — 22 tasks on `main`; suite 70 passed / 1 skipped; both user-gates
  re-validated. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-21-regatta-phase1.md` (historical).
  Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-regatta-phase1-architecture-design.md`.

## Cross-cutting decisions (canonical — lives nowhere else)

- **Method 1 = hand-rolled dense GP/OI** (not pyinterp/GPSat). Native covariance +
  whole-field samples via cached Cholesky `L` of `K_dd+R`, `cov(A,B)=K_AB−Vᵀ_A V_B`,
  `V_X=L⁻¹K_dX`. `R` is a structured operator (diagonal for nadir). Two complementary
  seams: `LinearSolver` (methods/, backend swap *within* the kernel formulation) and
  `CovarianceOperator` Protocol (core/, carries the kernel→precision/SPDE jump).
- **`CovarianceOperator` is the seam, not the GP.** `GaussianPredictiveDistribution(mean,
  cov: CovarianceOperator)` is method-agnostic; GP math lives in `methods/oi.py`. Operator
  declares `fidelity ∈ {EXACT, LOW_RANK, SAMPLE}`.
- **Exact/persisted boundary:** the unit of work returns the **Persisted** rep (mean +
  exact marginal var + low-rank `B` + clipped diagonal residual `d` + seed + sampler spec +
  rank `r` + captured-energy diagnostic), **never** a live operator carrying `L`. `B` from a
  matrix-free seeded randomized SVD of `P`; `d = clip(diag(P)−rowsum(B²), 0, None)`.
- **Unifying on-worker rule:** the worker extracts *everything needing the EXACT operator* —
  base reduction, declared derived quantities (first-difference), AND eval-point predictions
  at withheld/off-grid locations — before discarding the operator. Off-grid predictives are
  computed exactly, never by interpolating a marginal-variance field (invariant 7).
- **`Product` is an explicit bundle:** base + derived Persisted products + eval-point
  predictions, provenance linking each (route + `CovFidelity` stamped).
- **Derived dispatch = linearity × representation × `CovFidelity`.** Provenance stamps the
  covariance fidelity used. Only `firstdifference` is real (on-worker, EXACT); velocity/eke/
  transport/area_average are committed-signature stubs.
- **Data (Decision B):** real `DataSource` against ODC THREDDS + `./data/cache/`; daily
  NATL60-CJM165 reference (NOT the 11 GB hourly) clipped to 42-day window
  **2012-10-22→2012-12-02**; OSSE nadir obs ~285 MB whole. Committed tiny NetCDF fixtures for
  offline CI. Oracle = opt-in OI-RMSE parity **within 10% of the ODC OI baseline** (skipif no
  data/network; ≤25% for the tiny-fixture smoke run). OSE eval uses the withheld **CryoSat-2**
  along-track.
- **Space-time structure (load-bearing):** the GP covariance is space-time — spatial length
  scale × **temporal correlation scale**, both through the `ParameterProvider`. The
  unit-of-work window is space-time (spatial tile × temporal obs window around target output
  time(s); the 21-day spin-up gives early times temporal neighbors and bounds `N_obs`).
  **`GridSpec` stays purely spatial**; time is carried on the `Product` as a series of
  per-time persisted fields. One factored `K_dd+R` serves all output times in the window.
- **Kernel:** pinned to stationary **Matérn-3/2** (variance + spatial length + temporal
  scale), behind a `methods/kernel.py::Kernel` interface so it can go nonstationary later
  without touching `GPCovarianceOperator`.

## Cross-cutting decisions (canonical — Phase 3)

- **Two-point dispatch split (load-bearing).** Reduction strategy is selected by the LIVE
  operator's `representation` (pre-persistence): `select_reduction(dist)` in
  `distributions/reduction.py` reads `getattr(dist.cov_op, "representation", "lowrank+diag")`
  → `LowRankReduction` ("lowrank+diag") / `GMRFPrecisionReduction` ("sparse-precision"), or
  `EmpiricalReduction` when there is no operator. The coherence driver is selected by the
  PERSISTED `sampler_spec` (post-persistence): `select_driver(sampler_spec)` in `coherent.py`
  → `LowRankSharedBasis` / `GmrfPrecisionSolve` / `PerturbEnsembleDegradation`. Never dispatch
  on method identity.
- **`to_persisted` is NOT on the core Protocol.** §5.4's illustrative on-`CovarianceOperator`
  signature was self-inconsistent (it returns a `distributions/` type from `core/`, breaking
  the one-way `application/→distributions/` rule, and modifies the Protocol, violating
  invariant 1). Realized as the `ReductionStrategy` Protocol in `distributions/reduction.py`,
  selected by representation. Operators carry a `representation` class attr only (not on the
  Protocol). Spec §5 permits this ("signatures illustrative; correct where it differs").
- **GMRF reads off the precision via a `Projection`.** Precision-node space and output-grid
  space kept distinct even though they coincide on a regular grid. `mean→W·mean`,
  `cov→W Σ Wᵀ` (Σ = selective-inverse entries in W's stencil, never dense). Grid block =
  `GridIdentityProjection` (W=identity-on-nodes); off-grid = `BilinearProjection`; `A`
  (grid→obs conditioning) is itself a projection into node space. A later FEM phase supplies
  a new `Projection` + mesh-assembly only — precision rep, coherence driver, persistence, and
  blend untouched. (Recorded in `phase3_scope_spec.md` §5.1.)
- **GMRF time = temporal taper into R (not a temporal SPDE axis).** `Q_post = Q_prior +
  AᵀR⁻¹A`; R per-obs variance inflated by `exp(|t_obs−t_out|/temporal_taper_scale)`; the
  taper scale is a tunable in `parameter_space()` resolved via the provider. Conservative
  diagonal-R approximation (under-uses temporal structure) recorded as a `known_bias`. The
  OI-vs-GMRF asymmetry (OI = full space-time kernel; GMRF = spatial cov + tapered likelihood)
  is deliberate and read into the Stage-B comparison.
- **One sparse factor serves all three (invariant 6).** `GMRFFactor` (CHOLMOD simplicial)
  serves `sample` (L⁻ᵀw), `solve` (posterior mean), and the hand-rolled Takahashi selective
  inverse (`diag(Q⁻¹)` + adjacent entries on the L+Lᵀ pattern). Dense `Q⁻¹` exists ONLY as a
  small-grid test oracle. Adjacency precondition (W's 4-node stencil + firstdifference's
  adjacent-node cov inside the selective-inverse pattern) is asserted — guards a future wider
  κ-stencil from silently breaking eval var / cancellation.
- **GMRF eval-point OSE blend = moment crossfade.** GMRF has no low-rank eval factor; cross-
  tile eval-point scoring uses `mean=Σwμ`, `var=(Σwσ)²` (exact per-tile var from Takahashi).
  Cross-eval-point covariance in overlaps is NOT represented (not consumed by per-point OSE
  accuracy/calibration) — recorded in provenance (`eval_point_cov` marker), a flag not a
  hidden assumption. Full coherent eval-point GMRF sampling is out of Phase-3 scope.
- **α = 2 (ν = 1)** fixed integer smoothness — the canonical `(κ²I−Δ)` 5-point stencil
  squared. Continuous ν deferred to Phase 4.

## Cross-cutting decisions (canonical — Phase 2)

- **Coherent-sample structured driver = shared-overlap-basis (Löwdin), NOT member-only z_r.**
  The design's default Option-1 (member-only `z_r` applied to each tile's own factor) was
  escalated and rejected at the Stage-A gate (design §8). Diagnostics proved it was NOT a
  sampler bug (diagonal exact; core/aligned ≈ MC floor) but a genuine, *large, k-independent*
  basis-orientation residual: each tile builds an independent rank-20 randomized-SVD basis, so
  the structured factors are ~orthogonal across tiles (structured ratio ≈ 0.39) and member-only
  `z_r` makes them add as if independent → coherent samples underdispersed ~40–67% vs the
  reported cheap-path variance, *growing* with k. Fix (`coherent_structured_field` in
  `distributions/coherent.py`, used by `BlendedDistribution._coherent_member`): project every
  tile factor into ONE common orthonormal basis `Q` (QR of the stacked factors over the
  support), take the symmetric square root `Aᵢ=(QᵀFᵢ Fᵢᵀ Q)^½` to strip the SVD rotational
  ambiguity, and drive `G=Σ wᵢ Q Aᵢ` with ONE shared member-seeded latent `g`. Result: cheap≈
  sampled rel 0.45→0.03 and k-direction flipped growing→flat; cross-seam derivative recovers.
  The reported marginal (`BlendOperator.blend`'s `(Σwσ)²`) is UNCHANGED (still conservative;
  Task-3 cheap path untouched) — only the *sampler* changed. `MemberSeededZr`/`realize_one`
  remain for single-tile use. If Stage B's larger overlaps degrade `Q` conditioning, the next
  lever is the retained per-tile rank, NOT the driver (owner directive).
- **`run_tiled_pipeline`** (`application/pipeline.py`) reuses Phase-1 `_prepare`/evaluators:
  per-tile obs windowed to `extended_window`, eval locations windowed per tile, one submit per
  tile via the existing `Executor`, grid blend + OSE eval-point `PointSet` blend, then the
  Phase-1 `Registry`. OSSE scores the blended grid vs truth; OSE scores blended eval-point
  predictives vs withheld CryoSat-2. `UnitOfWork.obs` relaxed to `ObsWindow | None` (None only
  for obs-less coordinator probes in tests; real solves always set it).

## Gotchas

- **mypy runs `mypy .` (whole tree, tests included)** via the pre-commit hook — test files
  must be type-clean too (e.g. assert `x is not None` before using an `Optional`). numpy ops
  often infer `Any`; wrap returns in `np.asarray(...)` to satisfy `no-any-return`. scipy/dask/
  distributed calls need `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` / `[no-untyped-call]`.
- **Plan deviations made & verified:** (1) Task 10 perturb_and_ensemble seeds members from the
  caller seed + index, not `id(obs)` (the plan's id-based seed broke the reproducibility test).
  (2) Task 19 CRPS test: the plan's expected `0.23379` is CRPS at y=0, but the test uses y=0.5;
  correct closed-form value is `0.331404`. Implementation formula is the standard correct CRPS.
  (3) Task 19/21: evaluators take `result: object` (not `dict[...]`) so they conform to the
  `Evaluator` protocol and can go into `Registry([...])`. (4) Task 21 `_evaluate`: OSSE runs
  calibration on the gridded truth (the plan only set TRUTH, so Calibration — which needs
  WITHHELD_OBS — would never fire and the OSSE acceptance demands reduced_chi2/coverage); OSE
  withholds CryoSat-2 by mission-splitting the obs window (the test passes a plain FixtureSource
  with no `withheld()` method, so withholding must happen in the pipeline, not the source).

- **Task-1 deviation (verified):** `.gitignore` never ignored `__pycache__`/`*.pyc`, so Phase 1
  left 77 `.pyc` files tracked. The rename swept them in; untracked them (`git rm --cached`) and
  added `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.mypy_cache/` to `.gitignore` so the soon-public repo stays
  clean. `pixi.lock` (593 KB) exceeds the 500 KB hook only under `--all-files`; it is unmodified
  so the staged-only commit hook passes.
- The 11 GB NATL60 reference is hourly — never pull it; use the daily file. Footprint stays a
  few hundred MB.
- NATL60 challenge has no observation error ⇒ `R` ≈ a nugget for the oracle.
- `pyinterp` / `GPSat` are NOT installed; Method 1 needs none. `pixi add` any new dep.
- BLAS/OpenMP env vars must be set per-worker *before* numpy/BLAS loads (Nanny child env).
- **Phase-2 Task 11 deviation (verified):** `ScaleAwareHalo.halo_for` evaluates the
  correlation length at the band's *equatorward-most* latitude (`clamp(0, lat_lo, lat_hi)`),
  not at the band's lat nodes as the plan literal showed. The plan test asserts the halo for
  band (-5,5) equals `k*800` (equator cl), which the node-based version (cl at ±5 ≈ 797)
  would miss. Correlation length is monotone-decreasing in |lat|, so the widest over a band
  is at min|lat| — this is the correct "widest over the core band".
- **Phase-2 Task 6 deviation (verified):** `FirstDifference._diff_var` calls
  `dist.covariance(a,a/b,b/a,b)` node-by-node; the naive general-path covariance
  (regenerate 256 members per query point) made the composition test take 67s. Fix:
  `BlendedDistribution.covariance` now snaps query points to nearest grid nodes and reads
  from one cached `_grid_sample_batch(256)` realization (lazily computed, memoized on the
  instance). 67s → ~4s. Snapping is consistent with `PersistedDistribution.covariance`
  (which also snaps via `_idx`); fine for grid-node derived ops. The plan explicitly
  allowed this fast path (Task 6 Step 3).

## Deferred items / open questions

- **Next release — relax the conda recipe Python cap.** `pyproject.toml` now declares
  `requires-python = ">=3.12"` (cap dropped, commit `e236591`; source uses only stable stdlib
  and numpy/scipy/pyproj all ship cp314 wheels). The **0.1.0** recipe deliberately keeps
  `run: python >={{ python_min }},<3.14` to match the already-published 0.1.0 wheel (building
  0.1.0 on 3.14 would fail `pip install .` — its metadata excludes 3.14). On the next release:
  when the autotick bot opens the feedstock bump PR, drop the `,<3.14` from the `run` pin
  (→ `python >={{ python_min }}`) and mirror the same in `conda-recipe/meta.yaml`. Do NOT do
  this before a `>=3.12` wheel is on PyPI.
- **Optional:** `pixi.toml` dev pin still `python = ">=3.12,<3.14"` (left capped to avoid a
  `pixi.lock` re-solve; doesn't limit the published package). Relax only if CI should exercise 3.14.
